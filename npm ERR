Firstly Try this 
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE npm error
npm cache clean --force

Second Method :-

npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR! errno 2

Step 1: $ npm cache clean --force

Step 2: Delete node_modules by $ rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json folder or delete it manually by going into the directory and right-click 
Error :->delete / move to trash. Also, delete package-lock.json file too.

Step 3: npm install

To start again, $ npm start

This worked for me. Hopes it works for you too.


PS: If it is still there, kindly check the error it is displaying and act accordingly. This error is specific to node.js environment.

Third Method
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR! errno 1
rm -rf node_modules && rm ./package-lock.json && npm install

Hope this Help you to solve it.
