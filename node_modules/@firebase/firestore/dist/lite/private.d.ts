 * - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete.
 *   For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be

 * - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found.
 * - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already
 *   exists.
 * - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the
 *   specified operation.
 * - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a
 *   per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
 * - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not
 *   in a state required for the operation's execution.
 * - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
 *   issue like transaction aborts, etc.
 * - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range.
 * - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled.
 * - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by
 *   underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors,
 *   something is very broken.
 * - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely
 *   a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff.
 * - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
 * - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication

 * the existing version for Set and Patch mutations. For Delete mutations, we
 * reset the version to 0.
 *
