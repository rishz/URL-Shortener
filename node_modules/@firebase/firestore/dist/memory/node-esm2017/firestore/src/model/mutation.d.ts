 * the resulting version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. As deletes
 * have no explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for

 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check
 * locally, we return an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us the
 * updated version.
 *
 * Note that TransformMutations don't create Documents (in the case of being
 * applied to a NoDocument), even though they would on the backend. This is
 * because the client always combines the TransformMutation with a SetMutation
 * or PatchMutation and we only want to apply the transform if the prior
 * mutation resulted in a Document (always true for a SetMutation, but not
 * necessarily for a PatchMutation).
 *
 * ## Subclassing Notes
 *
 * Subclasses of Mutation need to implement applyToRemoteDocument() and
 * applyToLocalView() to implement the actual behavior of applying the mutation
 * to some source document.
