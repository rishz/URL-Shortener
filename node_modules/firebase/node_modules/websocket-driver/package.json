  "readme": "# websocket-driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node)\n\nThis module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols that\ncan be hooked up to any I/O stream. It aims to simplify things by decoupling the\nprotocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code\nto stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything about how the\nprotocol actually works. Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with\npluggable I/O.\n\nDue to this design, you get a lot of things for free. In particular, if you hook\nthis module up to some I/O object, it will do all of this for you:\n\n* Select the correct server-side driver to talk to the client\n* Generate and send both server- and client-side handshakes\n* Recognize when the handshake phase completes and the WS protocol begins\n* Negotiate subprotocol selection based on `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`\n* Negotiate and use extensions via the\n  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\n  module\n* Buffer sent messages until the handshake process is finished\n* Deal with proxies that defer delivery of the draft-76 handshake body\n* Notify you when the socket is open and closed and when messages arrive\n* Recombine fragmented messages\n* Dispatch text, binary, ping, pong and close frames\n* Manage the socket-closing handshake process\n* Automatically reply to ping frames with a matching pong\n* Apply masking to messages sent by the client\n\nThis library was originally extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com)\nproject but now aims to provide simple WebSocket support for any Node-based\nproject.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install websocket-driver\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module provides protocol drivers that have the same interface on the server\nand on the client. A WebSocket driver is an object with two duplex streams\nattached; one for incoming/outgoing messages and one for managing the wire\nprotocol over an I/O stream. The full API is described below.\n\n\n### Server-side with HTTP\n\nA Node webserver emits a special event for 'upgrade' requests, and this is where\nyou should handle WebSockets. You first check whether the request is a\nWebSocket, and if so you can create a driver and attach the request's I/O stream\nto it.\n\n```js\nvar http = require('http'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {\n  if (!websocket.isWebSocket(request)) return;\n\n  var driver = websocket.http(request);\n\n  driver.io.write(body);\n  socket.pipe(driver.io).pipe(socket);\n\n  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {\n    console.log('Got a message', message);\n  });\n\n  driver.start();\n});\n```\n\nNote the line `driver.io.write(body)` - you must pass the `body` buffer to the\nsocket driver in order to make certain versions of the protocol work.\n\n\n### Server-side with TCP\n\nYou can also handle WebSocket connections in a bare TCP server, if you're not\nusing an HTTP server and don't want to implement HTTP parsing yourself.\n\nThe driver will emit a `connect` event when a request is received, and at this\npoint you can detect whether it's a WebSocket and handle it as such. Here's an\nexample using the Node `net` module:\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar server = net.createServer(function(connection) {\n  var driver = websocket.server();\n\n  driver.on('connect', function() {\n    if (websocket.isWebSocket(driver)) {\n      driver.start();\n    } else {\n      // handle other HTTP requests\n    }\n  });\n\n  driver.on('close', function() { connection.end() });\n  connection.on('error', function() {});\n\n  connection.pipe(driver.io).pipe(connection);\n\n  driver.messages.pipe(driver.messages);\n});\n\nserver.listen(4180);\n```\n\nIn the `connect` event, the driver gains several properties to describe the\nrequest, similar to a Node request object, such as `method`, `url` and\n`headers`. However you should remember it's not a real request object; you\ncannot write data to it, it only tells you what request data we parsed from the\ninput.\n\nIf the request has a body, it will be in the `driver.body` buffer, but only as\nmuch of the body as has been piped into the driver when the `connect` event\nfires.\n\n\n### Client-side\n\nSimilarly, to implement a WebSocket client you just need to make a driver by\npassing in a URL. After this you use the driver API as described below to\nprocess incoming data and send outgoing data.\n\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),\n    tcp = net.connect(80, 'www.example.com');\n\ntcp.pipe(driver.io).pipe(tcp);\n\ntcp.on('connect', function() {\n  driver.start();\n});\n\ndriver.messages.on('data', function(message) {\n  console.log('Got a message', message);\n});\n```\n\nClient drivers have two additional properties for reading the HTTP data that was\nsent back by the server:\n\n* `driver.statusCode` - the integer value of the HTTP status code\n* `driver.headers` - an object containing the response headers\n\n\n### HTTP Proxies\n\nThe client driver supports connections via HTTP proxies using the `CONNECT`\nmethod. Instead of sending the WebSocket handshake immediately, it will send a\n`CONNECT` request, wait for a `200` response, and then proceed as normal.\n\nTo use this feature, call `driver.proxy(url)` where `url` is the origin of the\nproxy, including a username and password if required. This produces a duplex\nstream that you should pipe in and out of your TCP connection to the proxy\nserver. When the proxy emits `connect`, you can then pipe `driver.io` to your\nTCP stream and call `driver.start()`.\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),\n    proxy  = driver.proxy('http://username:password@proxy.example.com'),\n    tcp    = net.connect(80, 'proxy.example.com');\n\ntcp.pipe(proxy).pipe(tcp, {end: false});\n\ntcp.on('connect', function() {\n  proxy.start();\n});\n\nproxy.on('connect', function() {\n  driver.io.pipe(tcp).pipe(driver.io);\n  driver.start();\n});\n\ndriver.messages.on('data', function(message) {\n  console.log('Got a message', message);\n});\n```\n\nThe proxy's `connect` event is also where you should perform a TLS handshake on\nyour TCP stream, if you are connecting to a `wss:` endpoint.\n\nIn the event that proxy connection fails, `proxy` will emit an `error`. You can\ninspect the proxy's response via `proxy.statusCode` and `proxy.headers`.\n\n```js\nproxy.on('error', function(error) {\n  console.error(error.message);\n  console.log(proxy.statusCode);\n  console.log(proxy.headers);\n});\n```\n\nBefore calling `proxy.start()` you can set custom headers using\n`proxy.setHeader()`:\n\n```js\nproxy.setHeader('User-Agent', 'node');\nproxy.start();\n```\n\n\n### Driver API\n\nDrivers are created using one of the following methods:\n\n```js\ndriver = websocket.http(request, options)\ndriver = websocket.server(options)\ndriver = websocket.client(url, options)\n```\n\nThe `http` method returns a driver chosen using the headers from a Node HTTP\nrequest object. The `server` method returns a driver that will parse an HTTP\nrequest and then decide which driver to use for it using the `http` method. The\n`client` method always returns a driver for the RFC version of the protocol with\nmasking enabled on outgoing frames.\n\nThe `options` argument is optional, and is an object. It may contain the\nfollowing fields:\n\n* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.\n  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.\n* `protocols` - an array of strings representing acceptable subprotocols for use\n  over the socket. The driver will negotiate one of these to use via the\n  `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header if supported by the other peer.\n\nA driver has two duplex streams attached to it:\n\n* <b>`driver.io`</b> - this stream should be attached to an I/O socket like a\n  TCP stream. Pipe incoming TCP chunks to this stream for them to be parsed, and\n  pipe this stream back into TCP to send outgoing frames.\n* <b>`driver.messages`</b> - this stream emits messages received over the\n  WebSocket.  Writing to it sends messages to the other peer by emitting frames\n  via the `driver.io` stream.\n\nAll drivers respond to the following API methods, but some of them are no-ops\ndepending on whether the client supports the behaviour.\n\nNote that most of these methods are commands: if they produce data that should\nbe sent over the socket, they will give this to you by emitting `data` events on\nthe `driver.io` stream.\n\n#### `driver.on('open', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when the socket becomes open.\n\n#### `driver.on('message', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when a message is received. `event` will have a\n`data` attribute containing either a string in the case of a text message or a\n`Buffer` in the case of a binary message.\n\nYou can also listen for messages using the `driver.messages.on('data')` event,\nwhich emits strings for text messages and buffers for binary messages.\n\n#### `driver.on('error', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when a protocol error occurs due to the other peer\nsending an invalid byte sequence. `event` will have a `message` attribute\ndescribing the error.\n\n#### `driver.on('close', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when the socket becomes closed. The `event` object\nhas `code` and `reason` attributes.\n\n#### `driver.addExtension(extension)`\n\nRegisters a protocol extension whose operation will be negotiated via the\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. `extension` is any extension compatible with\nthe [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\nframework.\n\n#### `driver.setHeader(name, value)`\n\nSets a custom header to be sent as part of the handshake response, either from\nthe server or from the client. Must be called before `start()`, since this is\nwhen the headers are serialized and sent.\n\n#### `driver.start()`\n\nInitiates the protocol by sending the handshake - either the response for a\nserver-side driver or the request for a client-side one. This should be the\nfirst method you invoke.  Returns `true` if and only if a handshake was sent.\n\n#### `driver.parse(string)`\n\nTakes a string and parses it, potentially resulting in message events being\nemitted (see `on('message')` above) or in data being sent to `driver.io`.  You\nshould send all data you receive via I/O to this method by piping a stream into\n`driver.io`.\n\n#### `driver.text(string)`\n\nSends a text message over the socket. If the socket handshake is not yet\ncomplete, the message will be queued until it is. Returns `true` if the message\nwas sent or queued, and `false` if the socket can no longer send messages.\n\nThis method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(string)`.\n\n#### `driver.binary(buffer)`\n\nTakes a `Buffer` and sends it as a binary message. Will queue and return `true`\nor `false` the same way as the `text` method. It will also return `false` if the\ndriver does not support binary messages.\n\nThis method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(buffer)`.\n\n#### `driver.ping(string = '', function() {})`\n\nSends a ping frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` and the\ncallback are both optional. If a callback is given, it will be invoked when the\nsocket receives a pong frame whose content matches `string`. Returns `false` if\nframes can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.\n\n#### `driver.pong(string = '')`\n\nSends a pong frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` is\noptional. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does\nnot support ping/pong.\n\nYou don't need to call this when a ping frame is received; pings are replied to\nautomatically by the driver. This method is for sending unsolicited pongs.\n\n#### `driver.close()`\n\nInitiates the closing handshake if the socket is still open. For drivers with no\nclosing handshake, this will result in the immediate execution of the\n`on('close')` driver. For drivers with a closing handshake, this sends a closing\nframe and `emit('close')` will execute when a response is received or a protocol\nerror occurs.\n\n#### `driver.version`\n\nReturns the WebSocket version in use as a string. Will either be `hixie-75`,\n`hixie-76` or `hybi-$version`.\n\n#### `driver.protocol`\n\nReturns a string containing the selected subprotocol, if any was agreed upon\nusing the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` mechanism. This value becomes available after\n`emit('open')` has fired.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
